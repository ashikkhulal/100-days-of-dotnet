## Structs in C#

Just like classes, structs can have:
- Private fields
- Public properties
- Constructors
- Methods

Object initializer syntax, introduced in C# 3.0, can be used to initialize either a struct or a class.

*Note: Structs and classes are similar, but there are several differences between them.*
