# DAY-011:

## Switch statement:

Multiple if statements can be replaced with a switch statement.

Note: case statements, with no code in-between, creates a single case for multiple values. A case without any code will automatically fall through to the next case.

## Break statement:
If break statement is used inside a switch statement, the control will leave the switch statement.

## Goto statement:
You can either jump to another case statement, or to a specific label.

Using goto is a bad programming style. **Avoid it.**
