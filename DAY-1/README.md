## DAY-1:

A sample program:

```
// Namespace declaration
using System;

// Class
class Program
{
    // Main method (entry point of the program)
    static void Main()
    {
        // Write to the console
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, beginner from Main");
    }
}
```

- Using system declaration: indicates that I am using the system namespace.
- Namespace: is used to organize our code and is collection of classes, interfaces, structs, enums and delegates.
- Main method is the entry point into the application.
