## Sorting a list of simple types:

Sorting a list of simple types like int, string, char, etc. is straight forward. Just invoke the `Sort()` method on the list instance and the data will be automatically sorted in ascending order.

If you want the data to be retrieved in descending order, use `Reverse()` method on the list instance.
