## The purpose of attributes:
Attributes allow you to add declarative information to your programs. This information can then be queried at runtime using reflection.

An attribute is a class that inherits from System.Attribute base class.

## Using an attribute:
There are several pre-defined attributes provided by .NET.

A few pre-defined attributes within the .NET framework are:
- Obsolete: marks types and type members outdated
- WebMethod: to expose a method as an XML web service method
- Serializable: indicates that a class can be serialized

## Customizing attributes using parameters:
 And it is also possible to create your own custom attributes.
