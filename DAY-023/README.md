## Overriding virtual methods:

Using virtual keyword in base class method and override keyword in the child class method.

## Polymorphism:

Polymorphism is one of the primary pillars of object-oriented programming.

**Polymorphism allows you to invoke derived class methods through a base class reference during runtime.**

In the base class the method is declared virtual, and in the derived class, we override the same method.

The virtual keyword indicates, the method can be overridden in any derived class.
