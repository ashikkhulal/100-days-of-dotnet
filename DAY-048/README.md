# DAY-048:

## Difference between types and type members:

In the example, Customer is the Type and fields, properties and methods are type members.

So, in general, classes, structs, enums, interfaces and delegates are called as types and fields, properties, constructors, methods, etc., that normally reside in a type are called as type members.

You can use `#regions <name>` and `#endregion` to organize your type members.
