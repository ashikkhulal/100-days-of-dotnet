## Method overloading in C#:
Function = method

**Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name, but, with a different signature.**

So in C# functions can be overloaded based on the number, type (int, float, etc) and kind (Value,Ref or Out) of parameters.

**The signature of a method consists of the name of the method, the type, kind (value, reference, or output) and the number of its formal parameters.**

The signature of a method does not include the return type and the params modifier. So, it is not possible to overload a function, just based on the return type or params modifier.
