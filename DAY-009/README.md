# DAY-009:

Comments are used to document what the program does and what specific blocks or lines of code do. C# compiler ignores comments.

To comment and uncomment, there are two ways:
- Use the designer
- Keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl + K, Ctrl + C` to comment and `Ctrl + K, Ctrl + U`to uncomment

**Note**: Don't try to comment every line of code. Use comments only for blocks or lines of code that are difficult to understand. **Write comments to explain why if necessary.**

## Single line comment:

`//`

## Multi-line comment:

`/* */`

## Intro to XML documentation's comment:

`///`
