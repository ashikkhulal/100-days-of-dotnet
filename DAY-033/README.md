## Differences between abstract classes and interfaces:

Abstract classes can have implementations for some of its members (Methods), but the interface can't have implementation for any of its members.

Interfaces cannot have fields whereas an abstract class can have fields.

An interface can inherit from another interface only and cannot inherit from an abstract class, whereas an abstract class can inherit from another abstract class or another interface.

A class can inherit from multiple interfaces at the same time, whereas a class cannot inherit from multiple classes at the same time.

Abstract class members can have access modifiers whereas interface members cannot have access modifiers.
