# DAY-059:

## Convert.ToString() vs ToString():

Conver.ToString() handles null, while ToString() doesn't, and throws a NULL reference exception.

Depending on the type of the application architecture and what you are trying to achieve, you choose one over the another. Hence one is not better than another.
